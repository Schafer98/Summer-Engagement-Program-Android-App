Paycom Summer Engagement Program - The goal of this project is to create an app for either the iOS or Android OS which presents information about an event on various levels, allows users to register for event/sessions, export to calendar, etc. For this project we will be mocking data that would typically come from an API call using stubbed data to mimic a response. The project will require the user to decide on the layout, flow, and coding to successfully demonstrate a basic understanding of mobile app development.

Here is a link to a Demo Video I made while running the app: https://drive.google.com/file/d/11ZXCm7q7Ji18OQBus-POzhqd2-IjhXZu/view?usp=sharing
